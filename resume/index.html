              This project was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic situation and
              could not finish it as all research labs were shut down. The goal
              was to be able to estimate the amount of particles moving between
              pixels by analyzing intensity fluctuations. This was due to the
              particles being too small for a DIC microscope to resolve. Check
              this <a href="/writings/20201210-particle_tracking/">post</a> to
              see more of what I managed to do in a month previous to the
              COVID-19 outbreak.

              Dr. Florin proposed that as bacteria cover a surface with biofilm,
              this would prevent vapor from escaping the surface, due to the
              benefits of a humid environment for the bacteria. I designed several
              experiments to test the evaporation rates of gel without bacteria as
              the control and gel with growing bacteria on the surface to compare
              their water evaporation rate. Unfortunately, no correlation was found
              between biofilm covered gel and evaporation rates.
