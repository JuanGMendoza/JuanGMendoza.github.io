              <h2>Blog Design Intro</h2>
              <span class="article-date">January 12th, 2023</span>
            </section>

            <p>
              Hello! This is the new blog page design. All blog posts are on
              this one page, as opposed to each post having a separate page.
            </p>
            <h3>HTML Layout</h3>
            <p>
              The HTML of this page is relatively simple.
              The <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> tag of this page is laid out as follows:
            </p>
            <code>
&lt;!-- Blog Page &lt;body&gt; tag's HTML Layout --&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;...&lt;/header&gt;

      &lt;main id="blog"&gt;
        &lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;

            &lt;article&gt;...&lt;/article&gt;  &lt;!-- Blog Post --&gt;
            &lt;article&gt;...&lt;/article&gt;  &lt;!-- Blog Post --&gt;
            ...
            &lt;article&gt;...&lt;/article&gt;  &lt;!-- Blog Post --&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;footer&gt;...&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
              Within the &lt;main id="blog"&gt; tag, you will notice a
              &lt;div class="wrapper"&gt; tag. This tag is used to center the
              page content on the screen with a maximum width set in the CSS.
              It also adds white space between each blog post entry.
              Technically, this tag is optional. However, it makes the layout
              look polished.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each Blog Post on the Blog page is contained within an
              <b>&lt;article&gt;</b> element. These article elements are laid
              out as follows:
            </p>
            <code>
&lt;!-- Blog Page &lt;article&gt; tag's HTML Layout --&gt;

&lt;article&gt;

  &lt;div class="article-text"&gt;
    &lt;section class="article-overview"&gt;...&lt;/section&gt;
    ...  &lt;!-- actual blog post content goes here --&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;aside&gt;...&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
              The article has a &lt;div class="article-text"&gt; and an optional
              &lt;aside&gt; sidebar element as direct children. Each article can
              have its own sidebar, as opposed to 1 page-wide sidebar. The
              sidebar lies below its article on mobile screens, and to the right
              on desktop. Excluding the sidebar just leaves that space empty on
              desktop screens, with no noticeable effect on mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from the tags you will use to create your blog posts, the
              &lt;div class="article-text"&gt; tag has one direct child tag:
              <b>&lt;section class="article-overview"&gt;</b>, which is laid
              out as follows;
            </p>
            <code>
&lt;!-- Blog Page &lt;section class="article-overview"&gt; tag's HTML Layout --&gt;

&lt;section class="article-overview"&gt;
  &lt;span id="{YYYYMMDD-blog_post_title}" class="article-anchor"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;{Blog Post Title}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;span class="article-date"&gt;{Blog Post Date}&lt;span"&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
              Within the &lt;section class="article-overview"&gt; are the three
              following child tags:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The article anchor, which is used as an anchor link for
                each blog post. It should have a unique id from all other blog
                posts so that it can be properly linked to. I used the
                "YYYYMMDD-blog_post_title" naming scheme to avoid most collisions.
              </li>
              <li>
                The article title, which should be an &lt;h2&gt; tag. All titles
                and subtitles within your blog post should be &lt;h3&gt; through
                &lt;h6&gt;.
                <i>(Note: if your blog posts were each on their own page, the
                title would be an &lt;h1&gt; tag and the titles and
                subtitles within the post would be &lt;h2&gt; through
                &lt;h6&gt;. This is because you should only have one &lt;h1&gt;
                tag per page. With all posts on one page, we should keep their
                titles as &lt;h2&gt; tags.)</i>
              </li>
              <li>
                The article date, which is given a grey hue in the CSS to
                distinguish it from the title.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              After the article overview, you can add whatever combination of
              tags you need to <b>create your blog post</b>. This is pretty bare
              bones, so if anything ends up not being accounted for, let me
              know. The next article will discuss a few different supported
              tags.
            </p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <div class="article-text">

            <section class="article-overview">
              <span id="20230112-blog_post_tags" class="article-anchor"></span>
              <h2>Blog Post Tags</h2>
              <span class="article-date">January 12th, 2023</span>
            </section>

            <p>
              All tags that are direct children of the blog post's
              &lt;div class="article-text"&gt; tag have added space between
              them to space out the content.
            </p>

            <h3>Text Wrappers</h3>
            <p>
              This text is wrapped in a &lt;p&gt; "paragraph" tag, which keeps
              all default CSS styles.
            </p>
            <span>
              This text is wrapped in a &lt;span&gt; tag, which has no semantic
              meaning.
            </span>
            <b>
              This text is wrapped in a &lt;b&gt; "bold" tag.
            </b>
            <strong>
              This text is wrapped in a &lt;strong&gt; "strong" tag.
            </strong>
            <i>
              This text is wrapped in a &lt;i&gt; "italic" tag.
            </i>
            <em>
              This text is wrapped in a &lt;em&gt; "emphasis" tag.
            </em>

            <h3>Lists</h3>
            <p>
              Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists are set to be slightly indented
              relative to the rest of the text, with some space between each
              List Entry. For example:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>This is an ordered list.</li>
              <li>It has three entries.</li>
              <li>It is slightly indented from the rest of the HTML.</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
              <li>This is an unordered list.</li>
              <li>It is also slightly indented from the rest of the HTML.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Code Snippets</h3>
            <p>
              As demonstrated in this article, you can add code snippets to your
              blog posts using the &lt;code&gt; tag. If you've looked at the
              HTML, you'll notice that the text within this tag must be
              completely unindented relative to the rest of the HTML. This is
              because the code tag is set to respect exact indentation and line
              breaks within the CSS. Thus, if you indent the text within this
              tag to align with the rest of your HTML, it will show those
              indentations in the code snippet shown to the user.
            </p>

            <h3>Headings</h3>
            <p>
              The headings' font size is slightly increased from its default
              values in the CSS. In order to not break the semantic meaning of
              the page by placing an &lt;h1&gt; tag in the middle of the page
              and an &lt;h2&gt; tag in the middle of an article, here is a photo
              of the different heading sizes relative to one another:
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/20230112-blog_post_tags/headings.png" alt="Blog Post Headings" />

            <!-- Images -->
            <h3>Images</h3>
            <p>
              By default, images will take on their actual file width. However,
              if they are too large, they will simply scale down to 100% width of
              the article.
            </p>
            <!-- Medium Image -->
            <img src="./assets/20230112-blog_post_tags/article-image.webp" alt="Article Image" />
            <p>
              The image above will likely fill the entire screen width on mobile
              devices, and have white space on either side for desktop devices.
            </p>
            <!-- Small Image -->
            <img src="./assets/20230112-blog_post_tags/article-image-300x200.png" alt="Smaller Article Image" />
            <p>
              The image above shows how smaller images will still center
              themselves, but will only ever be as large as their actual file
              size.
            </p>
            <!-- Figures -->
            <figure>
              <img src="./assets/20230112-blog_post_tags/graph-example.jpg" alt="Figure Graph Image Example" />
              <figcaption>Numbors Make Kewl Graffs</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              As shown above, you can also use an HTML &lt;figure&gt; tag with
              &lt;img&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; tags as direct children to have
              an image with italicized text below it. This is great if you'd like
              to add a graph image with explanation text below it, but can be used
              with any image you'd like to add a caption to.
            </p>

          </div>  <!-- ./article-text -->

          <aside>
            <b>This sidebar is optional.</b>
            <p>
              You can put text here if you want.
              You can also put lil images to spruce things up, as shown below.
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/20230112-blog_post_tags/sidebar-img.png" alt="/Blog Post 1 Sidebar Image" />
            <p>
              You can even put links here. This could be a good area for links
              that are supplementary to the blog post.
