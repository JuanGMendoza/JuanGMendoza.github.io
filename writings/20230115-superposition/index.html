            This post is meant for anyone trying to understand what all the hype about quantum computers is about, but is wanting to understand a little more the jargon mentioned in all the articles about it. More specifically, if you have a basic understanding of vectors, and want to learn what "superposition" means, you are in the right place! Hopefully after this you will be able to picture more than the common phrase used to explain it; "it is in both states at the same time!"
          </p>
          <h2>Mathematical Definition</h2>
          <p>
            Classical computers, like the one you are reading this article on, work with bits. A bit is any system that has two possible states. The convention is to label these states as "0" and "1". We are then able to represent information as a string of bits and create algorithms that process these strings in such a way that solves a problem we want.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quantum computers are built out of qubits. Qubits are bits that take advantage of quantum phenomena, to be more specific, superposition. Superposition is the ability of a quantum system to be in a state which is a linear combination of many other distinct quantum states. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This last sentence may seem like a mouthful of math jargon, what is a linear combination? How is this related to quantum states? Well, it turns out you may already know from high school math concepts. For example, in the figure below, we have a vector. In physics classes, it is often useful to decompose a vector into its x and y components. In this case, we can do so just by reading the graph. The x component, in this case, is 1.5, and the y component is 2. Now that we know the components of the vector, we can write a description of the vector.

          The most common way to describe a vector in introductory classes it to write both components inside a parenthesis, separated by a comma. In this case, our vector would be (1.5, 2).

          There is a second way to describe vectors, which is in terms of unit vectors. A unit vector is simply a vector whose length is equal to one. So we define the symbols x̂ and ŷ as unit vectors pointing in the x-direction and the y-direction, correspondingly.
