            <span class="date-text">January 13th, 2023</span>
          </section>

          <p>
            The
            <a href="/writings/20230112-blog_design_intro">
              previous article
            </a>
            discussed the HTML structure of blog post pages. This one discusses
            various tags that can be used in each post.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, all tags in the blog post have added space between them to
            space out the content. Demonstrations of common tags can be found
            below:
          </p>

          <h2>Basic Text Wrappers</h2>
          <p>
            This text is wrapped in a &lt;p&gt; "paragraph" tag, which keeps
            all default CSS styles.
          </p>
          <span>
            This text is wrapped in a &lt;span&gt; tag, which has no semantic
            meaning.
          </span>
          <b>
            This text is wrapped in a &lt;b&gt; "bold" tag.
          </b>
          <strong>
            This text is wrapped in a &lt;strong&gt; "strong" tag.
          </strong>
          <i>
            This text is wrapped in a &lt;i&gt; "italic" tag.
          </i>
          <em>
            This text is wrapped in a &lt;em&gt; "emphasis" tag.
          </em>

          <h2>Lists</h2>
          <p>
            Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists are set to be slightly indented
            relative to the rest of the text, with some space between each
            List Entry. For example:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>This is an ordered list.</li>
            <li>It has three entries.</li>
            <li>It is slightly indented from the rest of the HTML.</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>This is an unordered list.</li>
            <li>It is also slightly indented from the rest of the HTML.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Code Snippets</h2>
          <p>
            As demonstrated in the
            <a href="/writings/20230112-blog_design_intro">previous article</a>,
            you can add code snippets to your blog posts using the &lt;code&gt;
            tag. If you've looked at the HTML, you'll notice that the text
            within this tag must be completely unindented relative to the rest
            of the HTML. This is because the code tag is set to respect exact
            indentation and line breaks within the CSS. Thus, if you indent the
            text within this tag to align with the rest of your HTML, it will
            show those indentations in the code snippet shown to the user.
          </p>

          <h2>Headings</h2>
          <p>
            The headings' font size is slightly increased from its default
            values in the CSS. In order to not break the semantic meaning of
            the page by placing an &lt;h1&gt; tag in the middle of the article
            (there should only be one &lt;h1&gt; tag per page), here is a photo
            of the different heading sizes relative to one another:
          </p>

          <!-- Images -->
          <h2>Images</h2>
          <p>
            Note that each blog post lives in its own sub-directory within the
            "blog" directory. This allows you to group all assets with its blog
            post HTML file, and thus your image "src" attribute doesn't need a
            prefix before the filename.
          </p>
          <p>
            By default, images will take on their actual file width. However,
            if they are too large, they will simply scale down to 100% width of
            the article.
          </p>
          <!-- Medium Image -->
          <img src="article-image.webp" alt="Article Image" />
          <p>
            The image above will likely fill the entire screen width on mobile
            devices, and have white space on either side for desktop devices.
          </p>
          <!-- Small Image -->
          <img src="article-image-300x200.png" alt="Smaller Article Image" />
          <p>
            The image above shows how smaller images will still center
            themselves, but will only ever be as large as their actual file
            size.
          </p>
          <!-- Figures -->
          <figure>
            <img src="graph-example.jpg" alt="Figure Graph Image Example" />
            <figcaption>Numbors Make Kewl Graffs</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            As shown above, you can also use an HTML &lt;figure&gt; tag with
            &lt;img&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; tags as direct children to have
            an image with italicized text below it. This is great if you'd like
            to add a graph image with explanation text below it, but can be used
            with any image you'd like to add a caption to.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            This article demonstrated the CSS behavior of various tags that can
            be used for your blog posts.
            You can find a blank blog post template
            <a href="/writings/YYYYMMDD-template/">here</a>.

        <aside>
          <b>This sidebar is optional.</b>
          <p>
            You can put text here if you want.
            You can also put lil images to spruce things up, as shown below.
          </p>
          <img src="sidebar-img.png" alt="/Blog Post 1 Sidebar Image" />
          <p>
            You can even put links here. This could be a good area for links
            that are supplementary to the blog post.
