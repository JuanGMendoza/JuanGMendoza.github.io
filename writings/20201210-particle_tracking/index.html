          <p>
            My research advisor, Dr. Florin, came to me one day and proposed I
            worked on a project one of his previous graduate students left
            unfinished. The project consisted of analyzing pixel fluctuations of
            DIC microscopy images to determine the movement of particles that
            are too small to be resolved by the microscope.
          </p>
          <img
            src="dic_Trim.gif"
            alt="DIC"
            width="480" height="848"
            style="max-height:533px; width: auto;"
          />
          <p>
            After a week or two of learning the physics behind DIC, we spent a
            good amount of time figuring out the equipment, since this project
            had been abandoned for a few years. We were able to find a procedure
            guide that was written on how to prepare the samples. These
            consisted of a droplet of water with plastic beads placed on top of
            a rectangular coverslip, which would then be covered with a
            circular coverslip. This can be depicted in the picture below.
          </p>
          <img
            src="sample.png"
            alt="Sample"
            width="321" height="104"
          />
          <p>
            In order to prevent water from evaporating out of the sample, this
            needed to be sealed with vacuum grease around the edges of the
            circular coverslip. As one could imagine, this is very difficult
            since the circular coverslip is suspended on water, thus when
            applying a small force on the edge it would move instantly, and
            thus ruining the sample. Any attempt to hold the small coverslip
            while applying the grease with the other hand ended up getting the
            coverslip dirty and thus making it harder to observe under the
            microscope. If I was going to observe hundreds of samples, I needed
            to improve this preparation protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            I met a couple of times with Dr. Florin to come up with ideas to be
            able to hold our sample in place while applying the grease on it
            and at the same time keeping it clean. I 3-D modeled all of our
            ideas on Fusion 360 and this is what we chose to build.
          </p>

            width="600" height="359"
          />
          <p>
            Dr. Florin recommended we made it completely out of brass. This
            helps our tight fits to be able to slide effortlessly. I sent the
            design to UT's workshop, and after a month they had it ready for me
            to pick up.

            In the first picture above, the "piston" is upside down, this is
            how it should be in order to place the circular coverslip on top of
            it. This "piston" is hollow, this allows me to plug in a vacuum on
            the other end that will prevent the circular coverslip from falling.
            Then, the metal pins on the sides are removed, which allows me to
            rotate the middle piece 180&deg; and put the pins back in to
            guarantee correct positioning. There is a very thin O-ring at the
            end of the "piston" which makes contact with the circular coverslip,
            this allows us to make contact with it without getting it dirty.
            The weight of the piston will hold it in place, allowing me to
            rotate the bottom big cylinder and apply the grease around the
            coverslip.

            Unfortunately, the video above was the last time I saw my beautiful
            sample holder. COVID-19 started spreading in the US and every lab on
            campus was closed. I had planned to continue working on this for a
            month, and then I would start working with Dr. Shankar, who is a new
            faculty member at UT, at a quantum computing lab in the UT Pickle
            research campus. These two projects got canceled until further
            notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while, I found Dr. Reichl, and now I am researching quantum
            scattering with her, which I can do during quarantine as it does not
            require a lab. I think this ended up being the best for me because
            I think I will most likely end up researching theoretical physics.
            I wanted to try many different research areas before going to grad
            school to be sure of what I liked the most. Even though they have
            all been exciting, I think my heart lies in theoretical physics.
