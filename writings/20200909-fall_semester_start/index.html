            Hello! This is my first entry in my blog, and I am not really expecting anyone to read this. I just thought it might be useful for me in the future, as I have come to accept that my memory is not too great, and I will put these up on my website in case it could help anyone going through a similar situation. I apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes or badly worded sentences. I will probably write all of my blog posts as they come to my mind and not worry too much about reading them multiple times before posting.

            Classes started a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been one of my favorite semesters already. I was enrolled in a UGS class (a class intended for freshman students) before the semester started, but I managed to get that waived after years of fighting with the UGS office. This meant I had an empty slot in my schedule I could fill with any class I wanted since I already have the classes I need to graduate planned out.
            I fell in love with special relativity when I was introduced to it in Modern Physics, Dr. Sitz made a big emphasis on this topic, which ended up being my favorite from the class. Asides from that, every time there is a new article in Quanta Magazine related to general relativity I end up reading it to procrastinate other homework. I have always been really interested in general relativity, so I decided to take this class for fun. I was also very lucky that this semester Dr. Kilic is teaching it, and from what all my friends have told me he is the best professor for the class.

            It has only been 3 weeks into the class, and I am loving it. As soon as the homework came out I started it and finished it the same day, I was very surprised of myself as I had never done something like this before, considering it was a homework that we had a week to complete. Every class I have ever taken is always considering euclidean geometry, so I am very excited to see how to mathematically describe non-euclidean geometry. Maybe this is something I should pursue in grad school, as I seem to have a passion for it I did not realize I had.

            I am also taking graduate quantum mechanics with Dr. Weinberg, I was already thinking of taking this class, but as soon as I saw him listed I knew I could not pass this opportunity. I am not extremely familiar with his work, asides from the basic idea of showing that the weak and electromagnetic force are the same phenomena, and how this was a big pillar to build the standard model. I have not taken any class that had the subjects of particle physics or the weak and strong nuclear forces. I believe Quantum III here at UT is supposed to cover particle physics, but most people that have taken it say they did not learn much in the class. Also, some professors have recommended I take a different class to replace it, which is what I did with graduate quantum mechanics. Dr. Sitz told me that since most universities don't do 3 quantum mechanics classes as UT does, it is not likely they will expect me to know particle physics in grad school. But this seems like such an important part of physics that I will read a particle physics book either during winter or summer break.

            Over the summer I made my own custom smart home, but that probably deserves its own post.
