Phew! you made it all the way over here. Did you really think I would leave the key out here advertised by a huge crypto picture and name? You are on the right track though! Welcome to my website. I had not updated this thing in over a year until this contest. Don't worry there is not too much to look through, I am sure you will find it... Right? Worst case scenario you learn about some physics! What a fun challenge.
